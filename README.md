## Tooltip-dictionary

The project is based on the need that users, many a times, search for the meaning of a word and it's possible for them to forget it when they come across the same word again.  
This is aimed to be a simple browser extension, which once added, users can double-click on the word they want to search for, and get the meaning of the word as a tooltip.  
Additional functionality is aimed at creating a save button, which when clicked will be added to a list, that can be displayed on a new tab in the browser itself.
